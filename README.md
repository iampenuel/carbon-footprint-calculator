🌍 Carbon Print — Your Terminal Emissions Tracker (with Slight Judgment)

Carbon Print is a friendly little Python tool that gently exposes your lifestyle’s environmental impact by calculating your annual CO₂ emissions based on how much you drive and how much electricity you burn. All in your terminal. All using basic Python. 

It’s like an eco-intervention, but written by a beginner coder trying to save the world and debug syntax errors.

🎯 What It Does
Asks how many miles you drive per day

Asks how much electricity you use per month — then calculates your total CO₂ emissions.

Gives you a clean little summary in metric tons of carbon.

Built to show what you can do with variables, math, and empathy... all in Python.

🧪 Skills Used

input(), float(), print() with f-strings

Defined functions for modularity and clarity

Constants and basic math calculations

Absolutely zero external libraries (we rawdog Python here...still learning, I'll reach there soon...someday...we'll se!!)

🖼️ Sample Run
Miles per day driven? 25
kWh per month used? 300

🚗 Driving: 3.75 tons
💡 Electricity: 1.50 tons
🌍 Total: 5.25 tons
